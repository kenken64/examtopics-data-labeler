# Telegram Bot Answer Submission Fix

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. **Primary Issue: Question-specific Answer Keys**
**Problem:** Answer keys used `${quizCode}_${userId}` format, causing users to be blocked from answering subsequent questions after answering the first one.

**Fix:** Updated answer keys to include question index: `${quizCode}_${userId}_${currentQuestionIndex}`

**Code Location:** `bot.js:2373`
```javascript
// OLD (broken)
const answerKey = `${quizCode}_${userId}`;

// NEW (fixed)  
const answerKey = `${quizCode}_${userId}_${currentQuestionIndex}`;
```

### 2. **Session Validation for Change Stream Users**
**Problem:** Users receiving questions via Change Streams didn't have local sessions, causing validation failures.

**Fix:** Enhanced validation to check both local sessions and quizRooms collection.

**Code Location:** `bot.js:2321-2347`

### 3. **Database Validation Logic**
**Problem:** Answer validation tried to query quizzes collection with non-existent certificateId.

**Fix:** Updated to use embedded questions from `quizSession.questions[questionIndex]`.

**Code Location:** `bot.js:2438-2462`

## Test Results

✅ **Answer Key Fix:** Users can now answer multiple questions in sequence
✅ **Session Validation:** Change Stream users are properly validated  
✅ **Question Validation:** Uses correct embedded question data
✅ **Index Mapping:** Proper 0-based array access with 1-based logging

## Technical Details

**Answer Flow:**
1. User clicks answer button → callback with `quiz_answer_{A/B/C/D}_{quizCode}`
2. `handleQuizBlitzAnswer` extracts answer and quizCode
3. Gets current question index from quiz session
4. Creates question-specific answer key: `${quizCode}_${userId}_${questionIndex}`
5. Validates user hasn't answered THIS question yet
6. Submits answer using embedded question data
7. Records success/failure with detailed logging

**Key Files Modified:**
- `telegram-bot/bot.js` (answer handling and validation logic)
- `telegram-bot/test-answer-validation.js` (validation testing)

The telegram bot should now correctly handle multi-question answer submissions without the "Sorry, there was an error processing your answer" error on subsequent questions.
