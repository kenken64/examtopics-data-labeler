Frontend Railway deployment preparation with Next.js 14 and health monitoring

This commit prepares the Next.js frontend for seamless Railway.app deployment with production optimization and comprehensive monitoring:

‚ö° Next.js Railway Configuration:
- railway.json: Railway-specific deployment settings with health checks
- nixpacks.toml: Build configuration for Next.js applications
- Dockerfile: Optimized multi-stage Docker build with standalone output
- next.config.ts: Enhanced configuration with Railway optimizations

üîß Production Frontend Enhancements:
- Health check API endpoint (/api/health) for Railway monitoring
- Standalone output configuration for minimal Docker images
- CORS headers and security configurations
- Environment-based configuration management
- Telemetry disabled for production efficiency

üì¶ Next.js 14 Application Features:
- App Router with modern React Server Components
- TypeScript configuration for type safety
- MongoDB integration with health status monitoring
- JWT authentication system with secure middleware
- Tailwind CSS with component library integration

‚öôÔ∏è Environment Configuration:
- .env.railway: Comprehensive environment variables template
- MONGODB_URI for database connectivity
- JWT_SECRET for secure authentication
- NEXT_PUBLIC_PDF_CONVERSION_API_URL for backend integration
- Google Drive API credentials for file operations

üõ°Ô∏è Production Features:
- Health monitoring endpoint with comprehensive status reporting
- MongoDB connection testing in health checks
- Environment variable validation and reporting
- Memory usage and runtime metrics
- Error handling with graceful degradation

üìã Deployment Tools:
- deploy-railway.sh/bat: Cross-platform deployment preparation scripts
- RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md: Complete Next.js deployment guide
- Environment validation and dependency checking
- TypeScript compilation verification

üéØ Application Capabilities:
- AWS certification question management interface
- Interactive quiz dashboard with real-time statistics
- User authentication and session management
- Question editing with inline form controls
- Progress tracking and analytics visualization

üîê Security and Authentication:
- JWT-based authentication with secure cookie handling
- Route protection middleware for sensitive pages
- API endpoint authorization with role-based access
- Secure environment variable handling
- CORS configuration for API access control

üìä Health Check Features:
- MongoDB connection status monitoring
- Environment variable validation reporting
- Runtime metrics (memory, uptime, Node.js version)
- Service status with detailed error reporting
- Railway-compatible health endpoint format

‚ö° Performance Optimizations:
- Standalone build output for reduced container size
- Static asset optimization with Next.js Image component
- Automatic code splitting and bundle optimization
- Server-side rendering for improved SEO
- Memory usage optimization for Railway limits

üé® User Interface:
- Modern React components with shadcn/ui
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Interactive dashboards with Chart.js integration
- Real-time form validation and feedback
- Accessible UI components with proper ARIA labels

This provides a complete production-ready Next.js frontend deployment setup for Railway with health monitoring, authentication, and comprehensive AWS certification management functionality.
