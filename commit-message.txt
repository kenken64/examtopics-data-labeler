Add comprehensive Telegram bot management system to prevent 409 conflicts

MAJOR IMPROVEMENT: Complete bot lifecycle management solution

NEW MANAGEMENT TOOLS:
- bot-manager.js: Cross-platform process management with automatic conflict resolution
- bot.ps1: Windows PowerShell script with status checking and process control
- bot.bat: Windows batch file for command prompt users
- BOT_MANAGEMENT.md: Comprehensive troubleshooting and usage guide

ENHANCED BOT FEATURES:
- Improved error handling for 409 conflicts with clear user instructions
- Graceful shutdown with proper MongoDB cleanup and signal handling
- Enhanced startup with drop_pending_updates to clear stale connections
- Process title setting for easier identification and management
- Cross-platform compatibility for Windows, Linux, and macOS

CONFLICT RESOLUTION:
- Automatic detection and termination of existing bot processes
- Safe process cleanup with appropriate timeouts
- Prevention of multiple shutdown attempts
- Better error messages with actionable solutions

USAGE EXAMPLES:
- node bot-manager.js start (recommended - auto cleanup + start)
- node bot-manager.js kill (kill existing processes)
- .\bot.ps1 status (check if bot is running)
- bot.bat restart (Windows batch restart)

This eliminates the common "409 Conflict: terminated by other getUpdates request" error
and provides users with multiple easy-to-use management interfaces.
