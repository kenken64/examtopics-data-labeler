Fix Telegram bot access code validation for certificate mismatch

- Fixed critical security bug where access codes for one certificate could be used with a different certificate
- Issue: certificateId comparison was failing because session stored string but database has ObjectId
- Solution: Convert certificateId to ObjectId in getQuestionsForAccessCode method before comparison
- Now properly validates that access code belongs to selected certificate
- Users get clear error message when trying to use access code for wrong certificate

Example: AC-BG4F3QA3 is for Solutions Architect but was incorrectly allowing AI Practitioner access
