Fix payee status distribution in dashboard analytics

- Fixed field name mismatch: dashboard aggregation was using 'paymentStatus' but database uses 'status'
- Updated dashboard API aggregation to use correct field name ($ifNull: ['$status', 'Unknown'])
- Dashboard now correctly shows payment status distribution: Paid (4), Pending (1), Failed (1), Refunded (1)
- Resolves issue where all payees were showing as "Unknown" in analytics charts
- Added debug scripts to investigate and verify the fix

The dashboard PayeeStatusChart now properly reflects the actual payment status data from the payee management interface.
