# QuizBlitz Frontend: Remove Results Display

## Summary of Changes

The frontend has been modified to **skip showing question results** and go directly to the next question, providing a streamlined quiz experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Results View Display
- **File**: `frontend/app/quizblitz/live/[quizCode]/page.tsx`
- **Change**: Completely removed the results view that showed correct answers and explanations
- **Before**: Questions ‚Üí Results (5 seconds) ‚Üí Next Question
- **After**: Questions ‚Üí Next Question (direct transition)

### 2. Modified Timer Expiration Logic
- **Function**: `handleTimeUp()`
- **Change**: Skip showing results when timer expires
- **Behavior**: 
  - Last question: Go directly to final results
  - Other questions: Wait for backend to send next question

### 3. Updated Question End Handler
- **Function**: `onQuestionEnded()`
- **Change**: Skip results display in event handler
- **Result**: No temporary results shown between questions

### 4. Enhanced User Status Display
- **Addition**: Better status messages during transitions
- **States**:
  - ‚úÖ "Answer Submitted: [A]" (when answered)
  - ‚è∞ "Time's up! Waiting for next question..." (when timer expires)
  - üîµ "Select your answer above" (during question time)

### 5. Removed Unused Functions
- **Removed**: `showQuestionResults()` function
- **Reason**: No longer needed since results aren't displayed

## User Experience Flow

### Before (With Results):
```
Question 1 ‚Üí Answer ‚Üí Timer Expires ‚Üí Results (5s) ‚Üí Question 2 ‚Üí Answer ‚Üí Timer Expires ‚Üí Results (5s) ‚Üí Final Results
```

### After (No Results):
```
Question 1 ‚Üí Answer ‚Üí Timer Expires ‚Üí Question 2 ‚Üí Answer ‚Üí Timer Expires ‚Üí Final Results
```

## Technical Details

### State Management
- `showResults` always stays `false` for individual questions
- `questionResult` stays `null` to prevent results rendering
- Final quiz results still shown at the end

### Backend Integration
- Backend timer service still handles question progression
- Frontend waits for `onQuestionStarted` events for next questions
- No changes needed to backend logic

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling when questions don't load immediately
- Clear status messages during transition periods
- Timer state properly tracked

## Benefits

1. **Faster Quiz Experience**: No 5-second delay between questions
2. **Simplified UI**: Less cognitive load for users
3. **Better Flow**: Continuous question progression
4. **Mobile Friendly**: Less screen state changes
5. **Cleaner Code**: Removed unused results display logic
