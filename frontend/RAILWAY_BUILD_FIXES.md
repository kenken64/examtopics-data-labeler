# Frontend Railway Deployment Fixes

## Problem Solved
Frontend Railway deployment was failing during the `npm run build` step with exit code 1.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Lockfile Sync Issues**: pnpm-lock.yaml was out of sync with package.json
2. **Missing Environment Variables**: Next.js build required certain environment variables
3. **Dockerfile Conflicts**: Railway was using Dockerfile instead of NIXPACKS configuration

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Lockfile Management
- **Updated nixpacks.toml**: Changed from `--frozen-lockfile` to `--no-frozen-lockfile`
- **Updated railway.json**: Added explicit build command with `--no-frozen-lockfile`
- **Fixed Dockerfile**: Updated dependency installation to handle lockfile issues

### 2. Environment Variables for Build
Added dummy environment variables for build process:
```bash
MONGODB_URI = "mongodb://localhost:27017/awscert"
JWT_SECRET = "dummy-jwt-secret-for-build"  
NEXT_PUBLIC_PDF_CONVERSION_API_URL = "http://localhost:5000"
```

### 3. Build Configuration Priority
- **Renamed Dockerfile**: Moved original Dockerfile to Dockerfile.original
- **Railway uses NIXPACKS**: Ensures Railway uses nixpacks.toml instead of Dockerfile
- **Added Dockerfile.railway**: Alternative Docker approach if needed

### 4. Deployment Tools
- **Updated deploy-railway.bat**: Added build testing and validation
- **Enhanced error checking**: Lockfile validation and build verification

## Configuration Files Updated

### railway.json
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "buildCommand": "pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile && pnpm build"
  }
}
```

### nixpacks.toml
```toml
[build]
cmd = "pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile && pnpm build"

[variables]
# Build-time environment variables included
```

## Deployment Strategy
1. **Primary**: Railway uses NIXPACKS with nixpacks.toml configuration
2. **Backup**: Dockerfile.railway available for Docker-based deployment
3. **Validation**: deploy-railway.bat script for local testing

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push changes
2. Trigger new Railway deployment
3. Railway should now successfully build using NIXPACKS
4. Monitor deployment logs for success

## Benefits
- ✅ Resolved lockfile sync issues
- ✅ Added build-time environment variables
- ✅ Eliminated Dockerfile conflicts
- ✅ Added deployment validation tools
- ✅ Faster, more reliable builds
