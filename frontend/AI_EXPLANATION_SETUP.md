## AI Explanation Setup Instructions

The AI Second Opinion feature has been successfully integrated into your AWS certification question system! Here's what was implemented and how to complete the setup:

### ‚úÖ **What's Been Implemented:**

1. **New AI Explanation API** (`/app/api/ai-explanation/route.ts`)
   - Uses Vercel AI SDK with OpenAI GPT-4o
   - Accepts question, options, correct answer, and explanation
   - Returns AI-generated second opinion

2. **Enhanced Question Detail Page** 
   - New "AI Second Opinion" card appears after showing answers
   - Purple-themed UI with Brain icon
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Toggle show/hide functionality

3. **Smart AI Prompt Engineering**
   - Formats question and options professionally
   - Asks AI to explain correct answer and why others are wrong
   - Requests AWS-specific context and best practices
   - Allows AI to disagree with provided answer if incorrect

### üîß **Setup Required:**

**Step 1: Add Your OpenAI API Key**
Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` in `/frontend/.env.local` with your actual OpenAI API key:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-api-key-here
```

**Step 2: Restart Development Server**
```bash
# Kill existing server
pkill -f "npm run dev"

# Start fresh server
cd /home/kenneth/Projects/aws-cert-web/frontend
npm run dev
```

### üéØ **How It Works:**

1. **Navigate to any question**: `/saved-questions/question/1?from=certificate&certificateCode=AIF-C01`
2. **Select an answer and click "Show Correct Answer"**
3. **In the "AI Second Opinion" section, click "Get AI Second Opinion"**
4. **AI analyzes the question and provides:**
   - Clear explanation of why correct answer is right
   - Why other options are wrong
   - Additional AWS context and best practices
   - Alternative perspective if it disagrees

### üé® **UI Features:**
- **Purple Theme**: Distinguishes AI content from original explanations
- **Brain Icon**: Clear visual indicator for AI-generated content
- **Loading States**: Shows "Generating AI Analysis..." with spinner
- **Toggle Visibility**: Hide/show AI explanation as needed
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if API fails

### üìù **Example AI Response:**
The AI will provide responses like:
```
**Correct Answer Analysis:**
A. Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) is correct because...

**Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**
B. Root mean squared error (RMSE) is used for regression tasks...
C. ROUGE is designed for text summarization evaluation...
D. F1 score is typically used for classification metrics...

**Additional AWS Context:**
In AWS environments, BLEU is commonly used when evaluating...
```

### üîí **Security Notes:**
- API key is stored server-side only
- No client-side exposure of credentials
- Rate limiting handled by Vercel AI SDK
- Error messages don't expose internal details

The feature is now ready to use once you add your OpenAI API key!
