# Telegram Bot Polling Logic Improvements

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Enhanced State Transition Validation

**Problem**: Telegram bot was transitioning to next questions prematurely, before timer expired.

**Solution**: Modified polling logic to validate question transitions:

#### In `quizblitz-bot-polling.js`:
- Added `lastTimeRemaining` tracking to monitor timer state changes
- Added `questionStartTime` and `playersAnswered` Set for better question state management
- Implemented transition validation that only allows question advances when:
  - Quiz is starting (question 0) OR
  - Previous question timer expired (`lastTimeRemaining` was 0) OR
  - Legitimate progression after timer completion

#### In `bot.js`:
- Added `lastKnownTimerStates` Map for timer transition validation
- Enhanced state change detection to prevent premature question transitions
- Added validation logic that blocks question transitions when timer is still running

### 2. Duplicate Answer Prevention

**Problem**: Users could submit multiple answers for the same question.

**Solution**: Added answer tracking to prevent duplicate submissions:

#### In `quizblitz-bot-polling.js`:
- Added `playersAnswered` Set to track who has answered current question
- Check if user already answered before processing submission
- Reset answered players when new question starts

#### In `bot.js`:
- Added `quizAnswerStates` Map to track answers by quiz/user combination
- Check for duplicate answers in `handleQuizBlitzAnswer` method
- Clear answer states when new question is sent via `sendQuizQuestion`

### 3. Improved User Experience

**Problem**: Users didn't know what to do after submitting answers.

**Solution**: Enhanced feedback and waiting messages:

#### Both bots now provide:
- Immediate confirmation when answer is submitted
- Clear waiting message explaining next steps
- Different timer messages for users who have vs. haven't answered
- HTML formatted messages for better readability

## Implementation Details

### Question Transition Logic
```javascript
// Only allow question transition if:
const isQuizStart = quiz.lastQuestionIndex === -1 && currentQuestionIndex === 0;
const isLegitimateTransition = quiz.lastTimeRemaining === 0 || quiz.lastQuestionIndex < currentQuestionIndex;

if (isQuizStart || isLegitimateTransition) {
  // Allow transition
} else {
  console.log('Question transition blocked: timer still running');
  continue; // Skip processing
}
```

### Answer Tracking
```javascript
// Check for duplicate answers
const answerKey = `${quizCode}_${userId}`;
if (this.quizAnswerStates.has(answerKey)) {
  await ctx.answerCallbackQuery('‚ö†Ô∏è You have already answered this question!');
  return;
}

// Mark as answered
this.quizAnswerStates.set(answerKey, { answer: selectedAnswer, timestamp: Date.now() });
```

### Enhanced User Messages
```javascript
await this.bot.sendMessage(chatId, 
  `‚úÖ <b>Answer Submitted: ${answer}</b>\n\n` +
  `‚è≥ Please wait for other players to answer...\n` +
  `üìä The results will be shown when the timer expires or all players have answered.`,
  { parse_mode: 'HTML' }
);
```

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Premature Transitions**: Quiz won't advance until timer actually expires
2. **Eliminates Duplicate Answers**: Each user can only answer once per question
3. **Better User Experience**: Clear feedback and instructions after answering
4. **Improved Debugging**: Enhanced logging for troubleshooting state issues

## Testing

To test these improvements:

1. Start a QuizBlitz session
2. Join via Telegram bot
3. Submit an answer before timer expires
4. Verify:
   - Answer is accepted with confirmation
   - Waiting message is displayed
   - Cannot submit another answer for same question
   - Next question only appears after timer expires
   - Timer messages differ for answered vs. unanswered users
