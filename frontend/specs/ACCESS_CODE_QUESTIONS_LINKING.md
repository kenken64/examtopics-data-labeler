# Access Code Questions Linking System

## Overview

The Access Code Questions Linking System automatically and manually manages the relationship between generated access codes and certificate questions in the MongoDB `access-code-questions` collection. This ensures that customers with access codes can access the appropriate questions for their certificates.

## Architecture

### Database Collections

1. **`payees`** - Contains customer payment information and access codes
2. **`certificates`** - Contains certificate definitions
3. **`quizzes`** - Contains individual questions for certificates
4. **`access-code-questions`** - Links generated access codes to specific questions

### Collection Schema: `access-code-questions`

```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  generatedAccessCode: String,       // The generated access code (e.g., "AC-4AC2H2G")
  payeeId: ObjectId,                 // Reference to payees collection
  certificateId: ObjectId,           // Reference to certificates collection
  questionId: ObjectId,              // Reference to quizzes collection
  originalQuestionNo: Number,        // Original question number in certificate
  assignedQuestionNo: Number,        // Assigned question number for this access code
  isEnabled: Boolean,                // Whether question is enabled for this access code
  assignedAt: Date,                  // When question was assigned
  updatedAt: Date,                   // Last update timestamp
  sortOrder: Number                  // Custom sort order for questions
}
```

## Features

### Automatic Linking

**When new questions are added:**
- The `/api/save-quiz` endpoint automatically creates corresponding entries in `access-code-questions`
- All existing generated access codes for the certificate get the new question assigned
- New questions are enabled by default
- Assigned question numbers and sort orders are automatically calculated

### Manual Linking

**Access Codes Management Page (`/access-codes`):**
- Shows link status for each generated access code
- "Link" button to manually create question assignments
- "Unlink" button to remove all question assignments
- Visual indicators showing linked/unlinked status

**Saved Questions Page (`/saved-questions`):**
- Shows access codes with their link status
- "Link to Questions" button for unlinked access codes
- Automatic status checking when loading access codes

## API Endpoints

### 1. Auto-linking (Internal)

**File:** `frontend/app/api/save-quiz/route.ts`

**Function:** `updateAccessCodeQuestions()`
- Called automatically when new questions are saved
- Finds all generated access codes for the certificate
- Creates new `access-code-questions` entries for each access code
- Calculates next available question numbers and sort orders

### 2. Manual Linking

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/link-access-code`

**Body:**
```json
{
  "payeeId": "string",              // Optional: Link by payee ID
  "generatedAccessCode": "string",  // Optional: Link by access code
  "forceRelink": false              // Optional: Force recreate existing links
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Successfully linked X questions to access code",
  "linkedQuestions": 5,
  "accessCode": "AC-4AC2H2G",
  "payee": { ... },
  "certificate": { ... }
}
```

### 3. Manual Unlinking

**Endpoint:** `DELETE /api/link-access-code?payeeId=X&generatedAccessCode=Y`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Successfully unlinked X questions from access code",
  "deletedCount": 5,
  "accessCode": "AC-4AC2H2G"
}
```

### 4. Query Linked Questions

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/access-code-questions?generatedAccessCode=AC-4AC2H2G`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "questions": [...],
  "stats": {
    "totalQuestions": 5,
    "enabledQuestions": 5,
    "disabledQuestions": 0
  }
}
```

## UI Components

### Access Codes Management

**Location:** `frontend/app/access-codes/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- Table showing all paid customers with access codes
- "Questions Link Status" column with visual badges
- Link/Unlink buttons with loading states
- Toast notifications for success/error feedback

### Saved Questions Browser

**Location:** `frontend/app/saved-questions/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- Access code cards showing link status
- "Link to Questions" button for unlinked codes
- Status badges (Linked/Not Linked)
- Automatic status checking on load

## Workflow

### For New Questions

1. User adds a new question via the quiz interface
2. Question is saved to `quizzes` collection via `/api/save-quiz`
3. `updateAccessCodeQuestions()` function automatically runs
4. Function finds all payees with generated access codes for the certificate
5. New `access-code-questions` entries are created for each access code
6. Questions are automatically enabled and assigned sequential numbers

### For Manual Linking

1. User navigates to Access Codes management page
2. User sees "Not Linked" status for access codes without question assignments
3. User clicks "Link" button (ðŸ”—)
4. System creates question assignments for all certificate questions
5. Status updates to "Linked" with success notification

### For Manual Unlinking

1. User sees "Linked" status for access codes with question assignments
2. User clicks "Unlink" button (ðŸ”“)
3. System removes all question assignments for the access code
4. Status updates to "Not Linked" with success notification

## Database Operations

### Indexing

The system creates the following indexes for performance:

```javascript
// In access-code-questions collection
{ generatedAccessCode: 1 }
{ payeeId: 1 }
{ certificateId: 1 }
{ questionId: 1 }
{ generatedAccessCode: 1, sortOrder: 1 }
{ generatedAccessCode: 1, isEnabled: 1, sortOrder: 1 }
```

### Seeding

**Script:** `frontend/seed-access-code-questions.js`

- Creates initial question assignments for existing access codes
- Can be run to populate the collection with existing data
- Clears existing data before seeding

## Error Handling

### Automatic Linking Errors

- Logged as warnings, don't fail the main quiz save operation
- Non-blocking - quiz saves successfully even if linking fails

### Manual Linking Errors

- Displayed as toast notifications to user
- Common errors:
  - Access code not found
  - Payee not paid
  - No questions found for certificate
  - Conflicts when linking already-linked codes

## Security

- All endpoints protected with `withAuth()` middleware
- Only paid customers can have question assignments
- Access codes must be generated before linking
- Validates payee status and certificate relationships

## Monitoring

### Status Checking

The system provides several ways to monitor link status:

1. **UI Indicators:** Visual badges showing linked/unlinked status
2. **API Queries:** Dedicated endpoints to check question assignments
3. **Database Queries:** Direct MongoDB queries for troubleshooting

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Questions not appearing for access code:**
   - Check if access code is linked (`isLinkedToQuestions: true`)
   - Verify questions exist in `access-code-questions` collection
   - Check if questions are enabled (`isEnabled: true`)

2. **Auto-linking not working for new questions:**
   - Check console logs in `/api/save-quiz` endpoint
   - Verify payees have `generatedAccessCode` field
   - Ensure payees have `status: 'paid'`

3. **Manual linking fails:**
   - Verify payee exists and has paid status
   - Check if generated access code exists
   - Ensure certificate has questions in `quizzes` collection

## Future Enhancements

1. **Bulk Operations:** Link/unlink multiple access codes at once
2. **Question Management:** Enable/disable individual questions per access code
3. **Analytics:** Track question assignment statistics
4. **Notifications:** Email notifications when questions are linked
5. **Question Ordering:** Custom question reordering per access code
