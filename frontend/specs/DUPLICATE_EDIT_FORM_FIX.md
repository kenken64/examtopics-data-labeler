# Duplicate Edit Form Fix

## Issue
The saved questions question detail page (`/saved-questions/question/[questionNumber]`) had duplicate editing forms that could appear simultaneously, causing confusion and potential UI issues.

## Root Cause
The component had multiple places where editing functionality was implemented:

1. **Main Question Card** (lines ~565-634): Embedded editing fields within the main question display card
2. **Separate Editing Section** (lines ~775-854): A standalone editing card that appeared below the main content
3. **Duplicate Explanation Display** (lines ~638-665): A separate "Original Explanation Card" that duplicated the explanation shown in the main card

## Fix Applied
1. **Removed duplicate "Original Explanation Card"** - The explanation is now only shown within the main question card
2. **Removed the separate editing section** - All editing now happens inline within the main question card
3. **Added save/cancel buttons** to the main question card when in editing mode
4. **Consolidated editing flow** - Single, clean editing experience

## Files Changed
- `frontend/app/saved-questions/question/[questionNumber]/page.tsx`

## Result
- Clean, single editing interface
- No duplicate forms or explanation displays
- Save/Cancel buttons properly positioned within the main card
- Consistent user experience

## Testing
1. Navigate to saved questions page
2. Click on any question to view details
3. Click "Edit Question" button
4. Verify only one editing interface appears
5. Test save/cancel functionality
6. Verify explanation displays correctly when not editing

## Features Preserved
- ✅ Edit correct answer (dropdown with option previews)
- ✅ Edit explanation (textarea with markdown support)
- ✅ Save/Cancel controls with loading states
- ✅ Proper validation and error handling
- ✅ Clean UI/UX without duplication
