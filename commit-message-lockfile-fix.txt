fix(frontend): resolve Railway deployment pnpm lockfile sync error

- Add explicit build command with --no-frozen-lockfile flag to railway.json
- Update nixpacks.toml to handle package installation during build
- Create update-lockfile scripts for manual lockfile regeneration
- Update deployment documentation with lockfile management section
- Addresses ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE error during Railway builds

The issue occurred because pnpm-lock.yaml was out of sync with package.json,
specifically missing chart.js, googleapis, and react-chartjs-2 dependencies.
Railway deployment now handles this automatically with --no-frozen-lockfile flag.
