fix: resolve MongoDB restore command line parsing error

- Fix "Invalid Options" error by replacing --host with --uri parameter
- Change from: mongorestore --host user:pass@host:port --db dbname
- Change to: mongorestore --uri mongodb://user:pass@host:port --db dbname
- Updated both mongodb-restore.sh and mongodb-restore.bat scripts
- Added command echo for better debugging visibility
- Updated README.md with troubleshooting information for this issue

This resolves the MongoDB URI parsing conflict that occurred when mixing 
authentication credentials with the --host parameter.
