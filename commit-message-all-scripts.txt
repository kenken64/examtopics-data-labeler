enhance: update all git automation scripts to use file-based commit messages

- Updated git-auto.sh (Bash) to read from commit message files instead of parameters
- Updated git-auto.bat (Windows Batch) to read from commit message files instead of parameters
- All three scripts (PowerShell, Bash, Batch) now have consistent file-based approach
- Added proper file existence and empty file validation for all platforms
- Improved error messages with emojis for better user experience
- Default to commit-message.txt but allow custom file specification
- Use git commit -F flag to preserve multi-line messages and formatting

This provides consistent automation workflow across Windows (PowerShell/Batch) and Unix (Bash) environments.
