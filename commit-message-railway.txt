Backend Railway deployment preparation with production configuration

This commit prepares the backend for seamless Railway.app deployment with comprehensive production setup:

🚀 Railway Deployment Configuration:
- railway.json: Railway-specific deployment settings with health checks
- nixpacks.toml: Build configuration with system dependencies (poppler, tesseract)
- Dockerfile: Alternative Docker deployment method
- wsgi.py: Production WSGI server with Gunicorn configuration

🔧 Production Flask Application:
- Health check endpoint (/health) for Railway monitoring
- Root endpoint (/) with service information
- Environment-based configuration (production/development)
- Dynamic port configuration using Railway's PORT variable
- CORS enabled for frontend integration

📦 Dependencies and Requirements:
- Updated requirements.txt with pinned versions for stability
- Added Gunicorn WSGI server for production
- System dependencies: poppler-utils, tesseract-ocr
- OpenGL and font rendering libraries included

⚙️ Environment Configuration:
- .env.railway: Template for Railway environment variables
- Production Flask settings (debug=False, env=production)
- Automatic Railway environment detection
- Secure environment variable handling for OPENAI_API_KEY

🛡️ Production Features:
- Gunicorn WSGI server with 4 workers and optimized settings
- Health check monitoring and auto-restart policies
- Structured logging for production debugging
- Error handling and graceful failure recovery
- Security headers and production Flask configuration

📋 Deployment Tools:
- deploy-railway.sh/bat: Cross-platform deployment preparation scripts
- RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md: Comprehensive deployment guide
- Environment validation and dependency checking
- Step-by-step Railway setup instructions

🎯 Key Capabilities:
- PDF conversion and OCR processing endpoints
- OpenAI API integration for document analysis
- Automatic scaling and load balancing via Railway
- SSL/HTTPS with automatic certificate management
- Real-time logging and monitoring dashboard

This provides a complete production-ready backend deployment setup for Railway with monitoring, scaling, and security best practices.
