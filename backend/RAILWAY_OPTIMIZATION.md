# Railway Deployment Configuration Summary

## Problem Solved
The backend deployment was failing due to heavy dependencies (PyTorch, EasyOCR, Docling) that caused build timeouts and memory issues on Railway.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Railway-Specific Files Created:
- **requirements-railway.txt**: Lightweight dependencies for Railway deployment
- **app-railway.py**: Graceful dependency handling with fallbacks
- **Dockerfile.railway**: Optimized Docker build for Railway

### 2. Dependency Strategy:
- **Core Dependencies**: Flask, OpenAI, basic PDF processing (PyPDF2, pdf2image)
- **Heavy Dependencies**: Made optional with try/catch blocks
- **Fallback Processing**: Basic PDF text extraction when advanced tools unavailable

### 3. Railway Configuration Updates:
- **Builder**: Changed from NIXPACKS to DOCKERFILE
- **Dockerfile Path**: Uses Dockerfile.railway
- **Start Command**: Uses app-railway.py

## Feature Availability

### ✅ Always Available:
- Basic PDF text extraction (PyPDF2)
- PDF to image conversion (pdf2image)
- OpenAI integration
- Health checks
- CORS configuration

### ⚠️ Conditionally Available:
- Advanced PDF processing (Docling) - graceful fallback
- OCR processing (EasyOCR) - graceful fallback

## Benefits:
1. **Faster Builds**: Reduced dependencies = faster Railway deployment
2. **Reliability**: No build failures due to heavy ML dependencies
3. **Graceful Degradation**: App works with basic features even if advanced features fail
4. **Cost Effective**: Lower memory usage on Railway

## Deployment Process:
1. Railway uses Dockerfile.railway
2. Installs only essential dependencies from requirements-railway.txt
3. Starts app-railway.py with graceful dependency handling
4. Health check confirms service availability

## Future Considerations:
- Can add heavy dependencies back if Railway resources permit
- Advanced features can be re-enabled by updating requirements-railway.txt
- Local development still uses full app.py with all dependencies
