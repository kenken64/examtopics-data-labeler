enhance: modify git-auto.ps1 to read commit messages from file

- Changed script to read commit message from commit-message.txt file instead of command line parameter
- Added file existence validation and empty file checking
- Updated usage to be simpler: just run .\git-auto.ps1 without parameters
- Uses git commit -F flag to preserve multi-line commit messages from file
- Improved error messages to guide users on proper file setup
- Makes commit workflow more consistent with file-based message management

This allows for better commit message formatting and easier automation workflows.
